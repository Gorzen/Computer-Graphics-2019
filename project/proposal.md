# Title and Summary

Rollercoaster built with the "wave function collapse" algorithm. The idea is to have a functional procedurally generated rollercoaster, using predefined tiles and the algorithm mentionned above. Some expansions can be made, for example being able to "ride" it, building it on a procedural terrain, etc.

# Goals and Deliverables

The main goal will be to have a fully connected 3D rollercoaster, with a start and a finish. To this, we could have these expansions :

- Being able to ride the rollercoaster, from the start to the end, as a first person camera.
- First generate a terrain procedurally and then building the rollercoaster on it.
- Being able to have options to check before the generation of the rollercoaster (eg. maximum/minimum average slope, number of different rollercoasters, max/min length, etc.)
