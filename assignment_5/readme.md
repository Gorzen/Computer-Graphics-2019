# Assignment 5

### Placing the objects in the scene
In the function ``update_body_positions()`` we created a new helper functions called ``compute_planet_position()``, which simply helps us rotate a planet by computing the rotation matrix and applying it to the planet position.

We do this repetitavely for every planet, even the moon. But in the case of the moon we add to its position the earth position to offset it in the earth's orbit. <!--- (Je sais pas si c'est clair ^^) -->
